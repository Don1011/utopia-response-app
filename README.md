Response App for Utopia


To open the app visit https://fathomless-shore-12392.herokuapp.com/

__Usage__
The app's homepage displays a map that indicates markers. 
These markers indicate points in the map where there an incident related to insecurity is taking place.
These markers are currently being hardcoded; this is because the server side which is suppose to recieve a USSD request and respond accordingly is buggy.
